# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Clients: Individual Property owners Primary Clients, (PC), Vendors - Secondary Clients, (SL), Business Model / Strategic Intent We help homeowners list, manage, and grow their rental business across Airbnb, Booking.com, and other top platforms — while they relax and earn more. They will get a dashboard where they can monitor their business matrix. (The less info we give the better. In my view owners to be shown only how much is made and how much is on books and what is the forecast. Flat numbers & percentages.) They only need to know number and status of inquiries. so that it gives them confidence about future business. Arabian Nights consists of two wings. One revenue, reservation, CRMs, marketing & finance. The other wing is operations & BD. ops and bd to always have admin -1 access. Every dept will have a dedicated dashboard only related to their job. arabian nights to be able to accept bookings just like Airbnb and have a calendar sync option i-cal kinds, plus just like Airbnb payment options for people across the globe. The owners will be able to see only numbers. no other access. Vendors for areas that are outside of our approachable radius on world map the client will be shown a list of other vendors. also basically since vendors complete the hosting eco system to make this scalable hence when the owner requests for other services other than revenue and reservation the vendors page will be shown to the customer and vendors can register in the portal. and apartment owners are free to choose vendor of their choice. this will be part of the hosting ability score page. initial page check. if hosting ability is completed then the customer is taken to the info page where owner will fill all information and signup for a pilot run.
